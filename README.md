# Linkedtree
This project is a backend implementation for a platform similar to Linktr.ee or Bento.me, designed to allow users to create a single page with multiple links. The backend provides essential functionalities such as:

User Registration & Authentication:
Users can sign up using email, username, and password.
Secure password hashing using bcrypt.
JWT-based authentication for secure login.

Referral System:
Users can generate unique referral links.
Track the number of successful sign-ups from each referral.
Optional reward system for referrers (e.g., credits or premium features).

Password Management:
Secure password recovery via email with token expiration.
Password reset functionality with email verification.

API Endpoints:
RESTful APIs for user registration, login, password recovery, referral tracking, and reward redemption.
Protected routes for authenticated users.

Scalable & Secure:
Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
Environment variables for secure configuration.
Input validation and error handling for robust performance.

This backend is designed to be efficient, secure, and scalable, serving as the foundation for a multi-link platform where users can share their online presence seamlessly.
